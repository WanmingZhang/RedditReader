#  TTI Coding Challenge.txt

* Given a 'listing' endpoint to the reddit API (https://www.reddit.com/dev/api), display a list of reddit listings with the thumbnail and title. This list should be able to be paginated. Clicking on one of the rows should take the user to a view with the comments for that listing.



* Possible endpoints can be [hot, new, random, top] anything you like. An example URL would be http://www.reddit.com/r/all/new.json



* The UI should be kept simple, taking advantage of the UIKit framework. We are looking for clean, organized, and testable code. 



* The whole project should take less than a day to complete, but let us know if you'll need longer or have any clarification questions. Note this does not mean you have to return the project in <1 day. We know that your time is valuable and want to set proper expectations.
